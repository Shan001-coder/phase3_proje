 # CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

---

## 1. Business Understanding

### Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. When customers discontinue a service, the business not only loses direct revenue but also incurs higher costs acquiring new customers compared to retaining existing ones.  

The key challenge for the business is the **lack of early visibility** into which customers are likely to churn, making it difficult to intervene in time with retention strategies.

---

### Business Objective
The objective of this project is to build machine learning models that can **predict which customers are likely to churn** based on historical usage, service plans, and customer service interactions.  

By identifying high-risk customers early, the business can:
- Design targeted retention strategies
- Reduce revenue loss
- Improve customer satisfaction
- Optimize marketing and service resources

### Key Stakeholders
- Business management teams
- Customer retention and marketing teams
- Customer service departments

## 2. Project Objectives
- Explore and analyze customer churn data
- Identify the most important factors influencing churn
- Build multiple machine learning models for churn prediction
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Recommend the best-performing model for business deployment

---

## 3. Dataset Overview
- **Number of observations:** 3,333  
- **Number of features:** 21  
- **Target variable:** `churn`  
  - 1 → Customer churned  
  - 0 → Customer did not churn  

The dataset includes customer usage metrics, service plan information, and customer service interaction data.

---

## 4. Data Preparation
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Validation of data structure and data types
- Encoding of categorical variables
- Feature selection
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

These steps ensured the data was suitable for machine learning modeling.

---

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand customer behavior patterns and churn distribution.

Key observations include:
- Churned customers tend to make **more customer service calls**
- Customers with **higher usage minutes and charges** show higher churn risk
- International plan subscribers demonstrate different churn behavior compared to others

These insights guided feature importance interpretation and model selection.

---

## 6. Modeling Approach

Three supervised machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

Each model was trained on the training dataset and evaluated on unseen test data.

---

## 7. Model Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics Used
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy** – Overall correctness of predictions  
- **Precision** – Ability to correctly identify churners  
- **Recall** – Ability to capture actual churners  
- **F1-Score** – Balance between precision and recall  
- **ROC-AUC** – Ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn customers

### Model Performance Comparison

| Model                     | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | Churner Recall |key Insight                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logistic Regression       | 86%      | 0.83    | 0.18           | Poor churn detection; works for general patterns                       |
| Decision Tree (Optimized) | 94%      | 0.90  | 0.73           | Much better at detecting churners; strong overall performance          |
| Random Forest (Optimized) | 95%      | 0.94  | 0.78           | Best overall; accurately identifies most churners, robust and reliable 

> The Random Forest model consistently outperformed the other models.

---

### Why Random Forest Was Selected
- High overall accuracy
- Strong recall for detecting churners
- Excellent ROC-AUC score
- Balanced performance across churn and non-churn classes

This makes it particularly suitable for business use where **missing churners is costly**.

## 8. Feature Importance & Key Drivers of Churn

Feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model revealed:

- **Daily usage minutes and charges** are the strongest predictors of churn  
- **Customer service calls** strongly indicate dissatisfaction  
- **International plan status** influences churn likelihood  
- **Night usage and account length** have minimal impact  

---

## 9. Business Insights
- High usage combined with high charges increases churn risk
- Frequent customer service calls often signal unresolved issues
- Poor plan fit (e.g., international plans) can drive dissatisfaction
- Not all usage metrics are equally important for intervention

---

## 10. Conclusion
Machine learning models can effectively predict customer churn. Among the models tested, the **Random Forest model** demonstrated superior performance and reliability.  

Understanding churn drivers enables businesses to act proactively rather than reactively, reducing customer loss and improving long-term profitability.

---

## 11. Business Recommendations
- Prioritize monitoring daily usage and charges
- Reduce customer service call frequency by resolving issues faster
- Review and optimize international plan offerings
- Focus retention efforts on high-impact churn drivers

### Strategic Focus
Invest in **usage-based retention programs** and **customer service improvements** to directly address the primary causes of churn.

## 12. Next Steps
- Deploy the model to support retention campaigns
- Test targeted offers and service interventions
- Monitor churn patterns and retrain the model over time
