# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict customer churn.  
The goal is to identify at‑risk customers so businesses can take proactive retention measures.  

We iteratively developed models — starting with Multiple Linear Regression, then Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Regression Tree — and evaluated them using appropriate metrics.  
The **Random Forest classifier** was chosen as the final model due to its superior performance (Accuracy = 94%, ROC‑AUC = 0.94).

#Data Science Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, normalized features.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized churn distribution, correlations, and feature trends.  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Baseline: Multiple Linear Regression (poor recall for churners).  
   - Decision Tree: Improved recall for churners.  
   - Random Forest: Best overall performance, chosen as final model.  
   - Regression Tree: Applied for continuous outcomes (R² ≈ 0.60).  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC‑AUC.  
   - Confusion matrices (raw + normalized).  
   - ROC curve visualization.  
   - Feature importance analysis for interpretability.
